I started by installing the 4WD Car Kit. Then, I made the necessary connections and soldered the components to the Arduino Nano and moved on to the coding phase. However, instead of compiling the code all at once, I preferred to proceed step by step. After the Arduino software was successful, I moved on to developing the Android software. I completed the software step by step, checking it step by step. Finally, I developed the C# desktop software and completed the project.
