The TRS4R3N Robocar is a remote-controlled DC car project. It can be controlled from the desktop as a desktop application using the C#.NET desktop software. It can also be controlled from a phone/tablet using Android software.

Technologies Used:
- Arduino
- C#.NET (Desktop), Java (Android)

Components:
- 4WD Car Kit
- L298N Motor Driver Board
- HC05 Bluetooth Module
- Arduino Nano
- HC-SR04 Distance Sensor

I started by installing the 4WD Car Kit. Then, I made the necessary connections and soldered the components to the Arduino Nano and moved on to the coding phase. However, instead of compiling the code all at once, I preferred to proceed step by step. After the Arduino software was successful, I moved on to developing the Android software. I completed the software step by step, checking it step by step. Finally, I developed the C# desktop software and completed the project.
